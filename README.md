Zhi Chen and Erin Gaschott

# Building the Project
  Prerequisites: Haskell, the Wreq Haskell package, TidalCycles, and Atom text editor.

  To download Haskell, please refer to https://www.haskell.org/downloads.

  To download the Wreq package, please refer to https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wreq.

  To download TidalCycles, please refer to https://tidalcycles.org/getting_started.html.

# Running the Project
  1. In SuperCollider, start SuperDirt with
    SuperDirt.start
    
  2. In Atom, go to Packages->TidayCycles->Boot TidalCycles
  
  3. In a terminal, compile and run the Haskell file, Main.hs, with
    ghci Main.hs
    
  4. Run main with
    main
    
  5. Follow the prompt and do not execeed the limited free requests
  
  6. Copy the output that is in TidalCycles format and paste the output into TidalCycles
